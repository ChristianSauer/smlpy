# SMLPY - painless reading of power meters

## What is it?
smlpy enables reading of smart meter language (sml) data from a smart power meter ("Stromz√§hler").
This library is intended for newer smart meters which support publishing data through an IR sender. 
Older power meters are not supported.

You need a working IR-reading device for this, e.g. https://shop.weidmann-elektronik.de/index.php?page=product&info=24
which must be connected to an USB port.

Please note that this library only supports a small part of the SML-spec,
especially the sending part is intentionally omitted
